<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Many job sectors have a growing need for people with mathematical and analytical skills, increasing the number of opportunities for mathematicians outside of academia. However, many students are simply unaware of potential careers and the need for skills outside of academia. The goals of <i>Mathematical Careers Outside Academia</i> is to try and rectify this! Our goals for this program are:
<ul>
<li><b>Exploring Careers:</b> Expose graduate students to potential career paths outside of academia, which utilize the skills they will be developing during their Ph.D.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Identifying Skills:</b> Discuss the skills one needs to pursue the highlighted careers, as well as how one can develop these in graduate school. </li>
<br>
<li><b>Encouraging Career Management:</b> Encourage graduate students to think about career management as a lifelong process they should beginning early in graduate school.</li>
</ul>
The symposium will feature four 30-minute talks with individuals who successfully made the transition to careers outside of academia. The discussion will focus on exposing audience members to potential career paths as well as the skills needed to work in these areas.</p>

<p>This symposium is only possible thanks to the generous support of the <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu">Department of Mathematics</a> and the <a href="https://grad.wisc.edu">Graduate School</a> at the University of Wisconsin.
